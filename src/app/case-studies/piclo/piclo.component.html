                What is energy flexibility?

            <p>
                The world of energy is changing - we are moving from a centralised, fossil-fuel based landscape, towards a model based on renewables. In order to facilitate this transition, the infrastructure that supports and distributes the energy has to change into a flexible grid that adapts to seasonal supply and demand as well as to new models of energy generation.  Energy flexibility across the grid can be traded between flexibility providers (sellers) and  the grid network operators (buyers).

                Our aim was to replace a bureaucratic and lengthy process with a marketplace app.  The first step was to understand the big, complex organisations that pushed the flexibility tenders, the “marketplace buyers”, and in particular, the tendering and procurement processes.

                We partnered with one of the big network operators in the UK  (the “buyers”) and alongside Piclo’s CPO, we facilitated mapping workshops and separate structured interviews, in order to understand their energy procurement process. It was an omnichannel, crossfuntional and bureaucratic process that normally lasted for months.  
                For the workshops, we gathered representatives of the procurement, commercial, legal and communications departments, and mapped how each team participated in each stage. In the blueprint we indetified technology touchpoints, teams involved, as well as current pain points and opportunities.

                In order to formalise a list of features from the findings uncovered during the interviews and the mapping, we identified the assumptions that were implicit in our proposed solution. I took this an opportunity to get aligned as a team in terms of what we were building, so that we would have less meetings in the future.  I facilitated a workshop on assumptions gatherings, for the co-founders and lead developers. 
                The result was a list of features, which we affinity mapped and prioritised.

             The main assumptions then became hypotheses about features of the marketplace.In order to validate what we learnt from The Buyers, we built an interactive prototype from the initial research and tested it with The Sellers.

                An early piece of feedback was that we had oversimplified the Sellers’ assets. A much higher level of detail was needed for them to make sense to the Buyers This also meant that a more complex way to upload data was needed - we went from a simple form, to a bulk upload page with data validation.

                The original idea was to overlap the Buyers Areas of need and the Sellers assets, and to advertise any overlaps as a “match”.Feedback from the user was that displaying the assets ina map was a very helpful, however, co-location alone was too simplistic a criteria to generate a match. So, we dropped the term and the automatic matching, but we kept the visual overlap in the map. The need for displaying more information about the asset, so that the user could determine if there was an opportunity (our old “match”),drove my decision of making a split screen interface.

                The whole process took 6 months and several iterations of the prototype. During those months we:
                <br> 
                - Defined and standardised a selling process that all Sellers country-wise could agree on. 
                <br> 
                - Co-created a format for Buyers to upload data from their assets.
                <br> 
                - Defined standards in naming marketplace items and stages
                <br> 
                - Defined what information to reveal at what stages, in order to remain a neutral marketplace, compliant with the regulators.
